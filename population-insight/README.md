# Population Insight

Live demo: https://population-insight.netlify.app/

Let's build an application where we can generate insight from a given data of people with following information

Id

Name

Age

Occupation

Father's ID

We need following components on the UI

## 1. Histogram

- show number of people falling in the range of follwing sets

a. 0-5 Years

b. 5-12 Years

c. 13-21 Years

d. 22-29 Years

e. 30-50 Years

f. greater than 50 years

## 2. Pie-chart

- Depicts the distribution of people in different occupations in the given set.

## 3. Population Table

- we need to show a simple list of all people

## 4. Family Tree

- On selection of a row in the Population Table, one should be able to see the family tree. The family tree always starts with the top most root of that family and highlights the person selected.
